/**
 * Discover and call any method a Tenzro node serves.
 *
 * The typed clients elsewhere in this SDK cover the surfaces worth a dedicated,
 * documented signature — wallets, inference, storage, databases. This covers
 * everything else.
 *
 * It exists because the alternative does not work. A node serves ~900 JSON-RPC
 * methods and gains more with each release; an SDK that hand-wraps them is
 * always some months behind the node it is talking to, and the developer who
 * hits that gap discovers it at the moment they need the method. Here the
 * method list comes *from the node*, so a newer node simply reports more.
 *
 * Authorization is unchanged. A call through this gateway runs behind the same
 * admin-token gate, API-key scope gate, and default-deny classification as any
 * other call — it reaches exactly what your credentials already allow.
